# Tic-Tac-Toe - Github Exercise
A simple repository to practice the github workflow by playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Each player will have their own game board to manage so they can see both sides of the github process. 

## Instructions
- The game requires two (2) players - so pair up!
- Each player will fork this repository - creating their **owned board**.
-- Each pair of players will play two seperate games together - one on each players **owned board**. 
- Clone each other's boards.
- Create a branch on each board for your own moves.
- Use the github workflow of issuing pull requests and managing merges to the main branch.
-- It is encouraged to create merge conflicts in order to see how to manage those.
- **It is not required to play the game to completion - The goal is seeing the github workflow**


### Game Board
Bellow is an example of the game board found in **GameBoard.txt** simply replace the '-' with your game marker.
